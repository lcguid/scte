* ScreenCapture() *
 it does: capture the content of the screen of the equipment;
 receive: (1st arg) device name (path) for the port the equipment is 
                    connected to;
          (2nd arg) the file name where the image will be stored;
  return: nothing but the PCX file containing the captured image will 
          be created.
     obs: the equipment must be equipped with the so called HADRCOPY
          functionality.
