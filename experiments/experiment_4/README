             SCTE - Software for Controlling Testing Equipment
                           -- Experiment 1 --


What is it?
-----------

  Experiment 3 captures the wave form data points of the signal displayed in 
  the oscilloscope's screen.
  
  Note: this experiment has been designed to work with Tektronix oscilloscopes,   
  TDS-100, 200, 1000, and 2000 series. If you want to use another oscilloscope
  you may have to alter all SCPI commands in this application. Pleas consult 
  the programmers manual of your oscilloscope for a list of commands and
  functionalities.


Experiment preparation
----------------------

  The experiment preparation comprises of 2 steps:
  
  1. connect an SCPI capable oscilloscope to an RS-232 port using a null 
     modem cable;
  2. configure the device specific information in
     'experiments/experiment_3/etc/general.conf', parameters: 'DEVICE_1_*'


Running the experiment
----------------------

  In order to run the experiment simply execute:
  
    perl run.pl


Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------

  See experiments/README for details.
