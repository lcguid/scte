             SCTE - Software for Controlling Testing Equipment
                            -- Experiments --


What is it?
-----------

  SCTE Experiments are Perl scripts, part of the SCTE bundle, that provide
  examples on how to use the SCTE::Instrument module functionalities in order
  to develop an automated data acquisition system using testing instruments.


Dependencies
------------

  The scripts included in these experiments require the following Perl modules
  in order to work:

  o SCTE::Instrument => 3.0.0
  o Term::ANSIColor => 2.02
  o Math::GSL::Vector => 0.25_4
  o Math::GSL::Statistics => 0.25_4

  With the exception of the SCTE::Instrument module, you can install all other
  modules directly from CPAN [1]. For instructions on how to install Perl
  modules like these, see http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html.
  
  Work is underway in order to make SCTE::Instrument available from CPAN as 
  well. In the meantime refer to the README file under SCTE-Instrument 
  directory for installation instructions.

  The experiment scripts don't require installation although they depends on
  other Perl modules in order to work (see Dependencies section for more
  details).

  After installing all the dependencies, you can run the 'run.pl' scripts
  available for each experiment.
