  SCTE was originally developed by Luiz C. Mosta√ßo-Guidolin, and have 
  benefitted from massive contributions Rafael B. Frigori. It wouldn't be
  possible to exist without helpful insights from Roberto L. Parra, Heitor H.
  Federico, and Diogo B. Tridapalli. Last but not least, this application 
  couldn't definitely exist without the tons of manuals, how to's, tutorials, 
  and all related material made available by the Free and Open Source 
  community.
