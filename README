             SCTE - Software for Controlling Testing Equipment


What is it?
-----------

  SCTE is a bundle of Perl scripts and a library, that aims to be a simple, yet
  powerful, data acquisition system. It is designed to control instruments, such 
  as oscilloscopes and signal generators, that use the SCPI programming 
  language [1] for communication, and are interfaced through one of USB, Ethernet 
  (LAN), and RS-232 (serial) buses.

SCTE Components
---------------

  SCTE is comprised of two parts: SCTE-Instrument, and experiments.

  o 'SCTE-Instrument' is a Perl module that controls and interfaces instruments
    via USB, LAN, and RS-232 ports. It requires installation and is necessary in 
    order to run the 'experiments'.

  o 'experiments' is a directory containing two experiment examples (sub-
    directories experiment_1 and experiment_2) on how to use SCTE-Instrument 
    and develop a data acquisition system. The 'experiment_1' example, controls
    one oscilloscope connected via USB. The 'experiment_2', controls two
    instruments, one connected via USB and the other connected via RS-232. For
    details about each experiment, refer to the README files under each
    experiment directory, and consult the documentation (see Documentations
    section).


Installation
------------

  SCTE-Instrument requires installation, please see the file called INSTALL
  under 'SCTE-Instrument' directory.

  The companion experiment scripts don't require installation, and can be run
  directly, considering that it's dependencies have been met. Please see the
  README file under 'experiments' directory.


Known Bugs
----------

  There are no known bugs at this time, if you find one please report it. It is
  the only way we can correct it and improve SCTE stability and usability. For
  reporting bug, see Contacts section.
