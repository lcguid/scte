# What is it? #

SCTE is a bundle of Perl scripts and a library, that aims to be a simple, yet
powerful, data aquisition system. It is designed to control instruments, such
as oscilloscopes and signal generators, that use the SCPI programming
language ([1](http://www.ivifoundation.org/scpi/default.aspx)) for communication, and are interfaced through the USB, and
RS-232 (serial) ports.

# SCTE Components #

> SCTE is comprised of two parts: SCTE-Instrument, and experiments.

  * 'SCTE-Instrument' is a Perl module that controls and interfaces instruments via USB or RS-232 ports. It requires installation and is necessary in order to run the 'experiments'.

  * 'experiments' is a directory containing two experiment examples (sub-directories experiment\_1 and experiment\_2) on how to use SCTE-Instrument and develop a data acquisition system. The 'experiment\_1' example, controls one oscilloscope connected via USB. The 'experiment\_2', controls two instruments, one connected via USB and the other connected via RS-232. For details about each experiment, refer to the README files under each experiment directory, and consult the documentation (see Documentations section).


# Installation #

SCTE-Instrument requires installation, please see the file called INSTALL under 'SCTE-Instrument' directory or the web version [here](http://code.google.com/p/scte/wiki/Installation).

The companion experiment scripts don't require installation, and can be run directly, considering that it's dependencies have been met. Please see the README file under 'experiments' directory, or the web version [here](http://code.google.com/p/scte/wiki/Experiments).


# Known Bugs #

> There are no known bugs at this time, if you find one please report it. It is
> the only way we can correct it and improve SCTE stability and usability. For
> reporting bug, see Contacts section.

# Authors and Acknowledgments #

> SCTE was originally developed by Luiz C. MostaÃ§o-Guidolin, and have benefitted from massive contributions Rafael B. Frigori. It wouldn't be possible to exist without helpful insights from Roberto L. Parra, Heitor H. Federico, and Diogo B. Tridapalli. Last but not least, this application couldn't definitely exist without the tons of manuals, how to's, tutorials, and all related material made available by the Free and Open Source community.
